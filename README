To generate slides, you must have LaTeX with the Beamer package.
If everything is properly installed, a simple
    pdflatex talk.tex
should be sufficient to generate the PDF for the slides.

Image was created using xfig. If you edit, export from xfig to PDF. If
you are changing the size or shape, be sure to adjust the bounding box
in the LaTeX file.
